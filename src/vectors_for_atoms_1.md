# Atom Vectors - Atom2Vec

A popular representation of atoms as vectors appeared in (2018): Atom2Vec.

Atom2Vec uses defines a matrix ($X$) where each column is an environment and each row an element. Each $X_{ij}$ can be 0 or a natural number, and represents the _count_ of those atom-environment combinations.

In other words, $X$ is a co-occurence matrix of atom-environment pairs.

|  |(2)Sb3|(2)Se3|(2)Te3|(3)Bi2|(3)Sb2|(3)O2|(3)S2|
| ----          | ---- | -----|------|------|------|-----|-----|
| Bi| 1 | 1 |1|0|0|1 | 0 |
| Sb | 0 | 1 |1|1|0|0 | 1 |
| ... | 2 | 0 |8|0|0|4 | 3 |

The index `(N)` is the stoichiometry of the atom in the compound $\mathrm{Bi_2Sb_3}$ for the first column. Each atom-vector is sparse, since a particular atom binds to a small fraction of all groups.

## SVD Method

A normalised matrix $X_u$ is obtained by normalising each row vector independently. Using the euclidean norm (2-norm) allows for an intuitive similarity metric:

$$\mathrm{dist}(\vec{u_1},\vec{u_2}) = 1 - \vec{u_1} \cdot \vec{u_2} = 1 - \mathrm{similarity}$$

In their best-performing model, they compute $SVD(X_u) = U\,D\,V^T$, collect the $d$-rows with the largest singular values, and compute $F = U'\,D'$ where $D'$ is the slice of rows of D with the $d$ largest singular values, and $U'$ the corresponding columns.

> The strategy has certain beauty to it: the new f-vectors retain the inner product similarity but are denser. Though now, the columns have no explicit meaning.

### Findings

They find:

- Similar atoms have similar vectors,
- Increasing the distance threshold _in stages_, vectors can be clustered hierarchically, from the leaf-nodes (atoms) downwards (groups).
    - At some level, groups match the periodic table groups. (I don't know how the grouping is made unambiguous).
    - At a very large distance, all atoms merge into a single group. The result is called _dendogram_.

- Looking at the variation of some dimensions in the vectors, we can assign meaning to some of them.

### Benches

Then, they compared to "empirical features" &mdash; a vector `(group, period,...)`, randomly padded to match their $d$&mdash;, with the task of predicting the DFT-found formation-energies of $\approx 10^4$ elpasolite crystals ($\mathrm{ABC_2D_6}$). They represent each solid as a concatenation of atom vectors, and feed it to a hidden layer. (They also do other tasks.)

The paper ends with an interesting insight:

> Structural information has to be taken into account to accurately model how atoms are bound together to form either environment or compound, where the recent development on recursive and graph-based neural networks might help.
