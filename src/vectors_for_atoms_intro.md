# Atom Vectors - Introduction

These are some of my opinions and ideas after reading the "[Atom2Vec][PNAS]" (2018) and "[SkipAtom][Nature]" (2022) papers.

## Background: Vectors in NLP

Around 2014, Mikolov et. al. proposed an algorithm for machine-learning vector representations of words.

The insight was to encode information about the word's environment (neighbouring words). The resulting word-vectors had similar words nearby in vector space. And these vectors became useful for downstream tasks.

By exploiting the analogy that _words are to sentences what to atoms are to compounds_, computational chemists have built upon these findings.

## Vectors in Chemistry

Atom vectors can be _built_ from empirical features or they can be _learnt_ by an algorithm[^1]. Learning vectors yields more general-purpose vectors, and has won in popularity.

Both _Atom2Vec_ and _SkipAtom_ are unsupervised algorithms that obtain their atom vectors from databases of compounds. Atom vectors can be combined into compound vectors, and used for downstream tasks like property-prediction.

These approaches compete with others that use crystal-structure information. Without structural informtation they _tend to_ be less accurate, computationally cheaper to learn.

### Embedding

The vector representations can be sparse, like one-hot encoding, or dense, like most approaches. The components of the vectors can be all continuous (real) or all discrete (integers, natural numbers, binary).

Mixing up continuous and discrete components isn't common, nor it is to use complex numbers.

Usually, the term _embedding_ is reserved for dense vectors with real (continuous) components.

The collection of embeddings (which is a matrix) is called distributed representation (of words, atoms, compounds,..). Neural networks are also distributed representations.

[^1]: Empirical features refers to the group and period (and potentially charge, mass, ..). This was widely used prior to 2018, before the automated ones.
