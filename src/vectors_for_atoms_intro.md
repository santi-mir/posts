# Atom Vectors - Introduction

Representing atoms and compounds as vectors has been around for decades &mdash;including those that are machine-learnt.

A related term, _descriptors_, is generic and frequently used for expert-designed vectors. Anither term, _embedding_, is restricted to machine-learnt vectors.

In summary, these vectors (descriptors or embeddings) can be useful inputs to ML models for prediction tasks.[^1]

ML models _can_ be trained with simple one-hot encoded vectors, but descriptors and embeddings can lead to better results.

Embeddings for atoms were inspired by NLP models in the 2010s. One such example was learning [continuous vector representations of words][arxiv] by Mikolov et. al. in (2013). They proposed an automated mechanism generate word-vectors by absorbing information from that word's environment (neighbouring words).

They found that similar words had similar vectors. And the vectors also supported semantically meaningful arithmetic operations, and became useful for downstream tasks. A classic example was:

```txt
vector("Queen") = vector("King") - vector("Man") + vector("Woman")
```

By exploiting analogies like (Source: [Atom2Vec]):

and (Source: [SkipAtom]):

> atoms are to compounds as words are to sentences

computational chemists have built upon these findings.

## Vectors in Chemistry

Atom vectors can be expert-designed or they can be _learnt_ by an algorithm[^2]. Learning vectors yields more general-purpose vectors, and has won in popularity.

Both [Atom2Vec] and [SkipAtom] are unsupervised algorithms that obtain their atom vectors from databases of compounds. Atom vectors can be combined into compound vectors, and used for downstream tasks like property-prediction.

These approaches compete with others that use crystal-structure information. Without structural informtation they _tend to_ be less accurate, computationally cheaper to learn.

### What is an embedding?

At a basic level embeddings are _machine-learnt vectors $\in \mathbb{R}^N$._ But this isn't enough. Normally, they are also:

- Dense rather than sparse i.e they have few zeros,
- Real-valued rather than discrete,
- Non-human-readable (though some parts may be interpretable),
- Belong to a structured vector space: semantically similar vectors are close together and allow for meaningful vector-arithmetic.

Dense vectors are useful because training will be faster (than a similar sparse version).

### Featurisers

The strategy to generate the descriptors (atom or element-vectors) is called a _featuriser_.

Element descriptors can be:

- Simple: like hot-encoded, random;
- Human-designed: Composition-Based Feature Vector (CBFV) which are expert-curated vectors as in Jarvis, Magpie;
- Machine-learnt: embeddings, like SkipAtom.

which are combined in some way to describe compounds.

We can pick any of the already-computed element-descriptors and use them as inputs, or run the featurising process to make our own.

A performance-comparison of vector representations is carried out in ["Is domain knowledge necessary for machine learning materials properties?"][comparison].

Their conclusion is: Human-designed Composition Based Feature Vectors (CBFV like Jarvis and Olyinyk) outperform other methods if there isn't much data. This was prior to SkipAtom, but does include Atom2Vec.

Otherwise, performance in downstream tasks is similar to hot-encoded or random vectors.

> (...) Although new, data-driven approaches are of interest, those studied here have yet to surpass CBFVs in terms of material property prediction with small data.
