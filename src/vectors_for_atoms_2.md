# Atoms Vectors - SkipAtom

Atom2Vec was already described, now it's time for SkipAtom.

First, compounds are downloaded, then the atom-pairs-dataset is generated. The Voronoi Decomposition helps derive training-pairs from the unit cell. This is shown in the image below:

Next, use the dataset for training a shallow network, trained to predict the neighbour-pair. Visually, it looks like this:

- The resulting representation is dense and structured/semantic. This can be shown using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE,..)
- The architecture is described as:
    > (...) single hidden layer with linear activation, whose size depended on the desired dimensionality of the learned embeddings, and an output layer with 86 neurons (one for each of the utilized atom types) with softmax activation. (...) minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the predicted context atom probabilities and the one-hot vector representing the context atom, given the one-vector representing the target atom as input.

## Embeddings

Embeddings are vectors in real ($R^n$) non-random vector-space, representing an object. _Real_ here implies continuous.

Not all vector or distributed representations are embeddings.

For embeddings, similar objects have similar vectors, according to some metric.

## Representations of Compounds (Pooling)

The analogy to NLP is that _words are like atoms_, and _sentences are like compounds_. Hence, distributed representations of atoms can be combined (pooled) into a vector representing a compound.

Vector-pooling options are:

- _sum_: $\sum s_i \vec{a}_i$ where $s_i$ is the stoichiometry (can be fractional),
- _mean_: $\frac{\sum s_i \vec{a}_i}{\sum s_i}$, i.e. divided by total number of atoms (can be fractional too).
- _max_: $\mathrm{max}(M_i)$, reduces material matrix $\mathrm{M}$ to vector. Selects max value of each column, each row being an atom in the compound.

The resulting compound representation is then used for training a feed-forward NN on different tasks. Also benchmarked using MatBench.

The pooling can also be done with hot-encoded vectors. This is done in ElemNet (mean pooling), and in Bag-of-atoms (sum pooling). In these cases, the result is a _sparse_ vector.
