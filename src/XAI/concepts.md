# Explainable AI - Concepts

There are many definitions of what explanations are in the context of explainable AI. For example:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Explanations are answers to questions about the model's "behaviour" or operation. Examples of such questions are: _how_ it operates, _why_ it makes certain prediction, _what_ the role of certain part of it is, and so on.

This is in contrast to black-box models where no explanations are given except the model itself, and accuracy metrics.

The kind of explanation will depend on the _audience_, _context_, _AI development stages_ an so forth; [for example][radiology]:

> (...) there are two competing broad definitions of interpretability. Machine learning specialists seek to understand the mechanisms underlying their models, but doctors and other end-users simply want "human-style" explanations; the same sort of explanations they currently receive from other humans.

They further say:

> description is often post-hoc and may not accurately reflect the decision making process, it is the form of explanation that end-users currently expect and are satisfied with.

In that case, the important step was to train an RNN to emit text for any decision. The output is then judged by a clinician or field-expert.

Similarly, in synthetic chemistry, new candidates are vetted by expert chemists. Again, text can be a useful piece of information for the expert to work on, consider, evaluate.

If there is no human in the loop, this approach isn't enough.

There are many dimensions to explanations, besides the _audience_:

- Contexts: In areas of science, healthcare, finance, energy, weapons, and in general in large parts of automated decision-making. Critical due to transparency or ethical reasons.
    - Yet in other scenarios, explainability may not matter &mdash;but only the model's output, which a human expert could evaluate.
- Audiences: scientists, ML practitioners, developers, non-expertsand so forth.
- Stages: pre-modelling, modelling, post-modelling.

## Characteristics

We can consider characteristics of explanations independent of the audience and context:

- __Simplicity__: how easy to understand the explanation is. (The opposite term, _complexity_, could be used as well.)
    - This is correlated with how simple _the model itself_ is.
- __Completeness__: how accurately it describes the model's behaviour.
- __Level__ / __Mereological__: High level or lower level; coarse grained or detailed; selection of parts and functions.
- __Internal__ or __external__

<p>Completeness v. Simplicity tradeoff.</p>
</div>

This trade-off isn't universal but just a common case, particularly in deep learning; some other models are straightforward, in which case both characteristics can be high.

## Predictive power

__Predictive power__ is a characteristic of a _model_, not of an _explanation_ of a model. Yet, it is correlated to the characteristics given earlier: more predictive models tend to be more complex making harder to explain them.

The reason to include it here is that _predictive power_ plays an important role deciding which model to use.

In the image below, note that _understandability_ replaces _simplicity_, and _correctness_ replaces _predictive power_.

Let's now look at some actual methods.
