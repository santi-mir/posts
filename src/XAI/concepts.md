# Explanations

Explanations can be defined as

> Answers to a _why-question_[^logic_of_expl_hempel], with certain properties and structure.

The **caveats** include:

1. The _why-question_ may be implicit;
2. Other _question-types_, e.g. _how_, _what_, should be included;
3. Lessons and books explain _without_ any question, and that the important part is to fill-a-gap in imaginary or present askers.

Questions can be hint what _the gap_ is. _The gap_ though, oversimplifies learning as transferring a missing piece of knowledge.

<!-- Then be evaluated of behaviour, the individual process of changing neural connections, the environments that foster it. -->

## Characteristics of explanations

Generating explanations involve a _cognitive_ and a _social_ process. Below, I describe a version inspired by [Explanation in artificial intelligence: insights from the social sciences][explanations_social].

### Cognitive Process

The _cognitive process_ is the process of finding an answer, involving:

1. There is _something_ to explain (_explanandum_),
2. The explainer _filters_ aspects of the _explanandum_ deemed relevant (using prior knowledge),
   - If the explanation is known, retrieve it and skip the rest.
3. _Generates_ possible answers (through explanation techniques),
4. _Weight_ the likelihood of each hypotheses,
5. Possibly selecting the most likely until contradicted by experience or super-seeded (e.g. by a simpler explanation).

### Social Process

The _cognitive process_ and the specific case of inferring causes was described earlier. The remaining characteristic of explanations is the _social process_: communicating the answer.

When an explanation is communicated, the receiver may learn, adjust its knowledge, be more confused, reject it. For now though communication is considered independently of learning and knowledge.

[Gricean Maxims][gricean_maxims] are rules observed in _good_ communication. These rules can also be used as a guide for good _model explanations_:

- **Informative** (Quantity): right amount of context and details,
- **Truthful** (Quality, or Fidelity): Try to make it true,
- **Relevance** (Relation): do not state things that aren't needed (provide insight),
- **Manner** (clarity): express it in elegant terms.

Importantly, the paper above notes that _why-questions_ are usually **contrastive questions** e.g. phrased as _why P rather than Q_ instead of _why P_, where the _foil_ (Q) is frequently implicit.

Beyond these general aspects, any particular situation involves the asker acquiring certain knowledge, which is a learning process occurring inside the person. This isn't discussed here.

### Explanatory success

There are aspects that tend to make explanations (and the belief in a hypothesis) more successful:

- **Simplicity**: if it involves a shorter chain of causes, it is preferred,
- **Generality**: if it explains other cases, it is preferred,
- **Testable**: Can we do hypothesis testing via an experiment?
- **Prior knowledge/beliefs**
    - Conditions generation and veto of hypotheses. For example, "The drawer slides because it wants." may be ignored in different basis. Another illustrative example from [The structure and function of explanations][lombrozo]:
    > (...) If told that herring and tuna have a disease, naive participants are more likely to extend the property to wolffish, the more similar item, than to dolphins. However, among fishing experts, who can generate an explanation for why the property might hold (e.g. tuna contract the disease by eating infected herring), similarity is less predictive of property extensions. (...)

    - Aids selecting what seems causally / explanatory relevant from what is not. Consider two light beams interfering on a Sunday. The day is irrelevant (usually), we disregard a confounding factor.

### Metaphors: The Machine and The Agent

These are metaphors different audiences use to understand models, and can help generate explanations for them.

In the scientific and science-adjacent domains, models are conceptualised as _machines_: composed of parts, each with a function, a role.

Outside of science or the technical domain, they're conceptualised as _human-like agents_: explained in human terms, expected to be reliable, consistent.

In summary, explanations are answers to _why-questions_; _good_ explanations respect the Gricean maxims, and will be dependent on the audience (their preferred style, expectations, expertise). The metaphors can help think of an explanation-style a given audience.

A table summary:

| Perspective      | Model is a… | Preferred Explanation style           | Audience            |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Scientific**   | Machine     | Mechanistic, causal, formal | Experts             |
| **Human-facing** | Agent       | Intentional, narrative      | Users, stakeholders |

Many other metaphors could be proposed.

Another anti-clockwise rotation takes us to **induction** (generalisation,hypothesis): "II; III; maybe all I". -->
