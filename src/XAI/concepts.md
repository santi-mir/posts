# Explainable AI - Concepts

There are many definitions of what explanations are in the context of explainable AI (XAI), such as:

> Explainable AI aims to _describe a model's predictions or operation_.
>
> _How_ does it operate? _Why_ does it makes certain prediction? _What_ is the role of certain neuron or layer?

In this post, _model_ refers to the deep learning model; and _method_ refers to the explanation aspects.


## Dimensions of interest

Here the focus is on _some_ aspects of explanations (not of the model):

- __Simplicity__: how easy to understand the explanation is.
    - How much expertise does a human needed to understand it?
    - This is also correlated with how simple _the model itself_ is.
- __Accuracy__: How accurately it describes the model's behaviour? Can we predict using the explanation?
    - Does it lead to surprises or obvious contradictions?
- __Kind__: Textual, Visual, Local (some restricted domain) v Global, by example, by simplification (fitting a simpler model), feature contributions (measuring each input-feature contribution), Intrinsic vs Extrinsic, and so forth!

This trade-off isn't universal but just a common case, particularly in deep learning; some other models are straightforward, in which case both characteristics can be high.

### Predictive power

__Predictive power__ is a characteristic of a _model_, not of an _explanation_ of a model. Yet, it is correlated to the characteristics given earlier: more predictive models tend to be more complex making harder to explain them.

The reason to include it here is that _predictive power_ plays an important role deciding which model to use.

In the image below, note that _understandability_ replaces _simplicity_, and _correctness_ replaces _predictive power_.

Let's now look at some actual methods.
