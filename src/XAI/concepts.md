# Explainable AI - Concepts

There are many definitions of what XAI is. I like to define it as:

> XAI aims to make a model's predictions and operation understandable to humans by providing insights into _why_ a prediction was made and _how_ the model uses input features.

Note: in this post _model_ refers to the deep learning model, and _method_ refers to the explanation aspects.

Explainability can be viewed as a trade-off between how empowering an explanation is and how complex it is. This is explored next.

## Dimensions of interest

Here the focus is on _some_ aspects of explanations (not of the model).

__Complexity__: how hard it is to understand, operationally measured relative to a reference human or target audience.

__Insight__: how much the explanation empowers users to understand the model, either intuitively or quantitatively.

- Can we directionally predict using the explanation?
- Does it fail in some specific cases? Does it lead to surprises or obvious contradictions?
- Helps form an intuition of the model's workings?

__Other variables__: local vs global; intrinsic vs extrinsic. This forms four categories: intrinsic-global, intrinsic-local, extrinsic-global, and extrinsic-local explanations.

Given a category from the 4 above, we can think of explainability as $X_p = \frac{I}{C}$, that is, equals explanation-insight divided by explanation-complexity.

Opaque or black-box models are usually complex and have low intrinsic explainability (local or global), but they may have allow reasonably good extrinsic explanations (local and/or global).

__Predictive power__ is a property of the model, not of the explanation.

Highly predictive models (often more complex) are also harder to interpret, especially intrinsically (globally or locally).

Explainability methods often aim to approximate or simplify these models and explain them extrinsically (globally or locally).

## Taxonomy

Let's now look at how XAI methods are categorized in practice.
An interesting map using __Category, Principle, and Technique__ is given in [Principles and practices][principles_and_practices] (2021); a modified (crop) of the image is reproduced below:

The image also shows a useful classification of explanations by type or kind. Some of these are: textual, visual, Local / Global, Intrinsic / Extrinsic, by examples, using simplification (e.g. fitting a simpler model), feature contributions.

Let's now look at some methods.
