# Explainable AI - Concepts

There are many definitions of what XAI is. I like to define it as:

> XAI aims to make a model's predictions and operation understandable to humans by providing insights into _why_ a prediction was made and _how_ the model uses input features.

<!-- trade-off between how empowering an explanation is and how complex it is. This is explored next. -->

## Dimensions of interest

Here the focus is on _some_ aspects of explanations _and_ of the model.

**Insight of the explanation** : how much the it empowers users to understand the model, either intuitively or quantitatively. _How does the output change_ if we change this or that feature? _Does it fail in some specific cases_?

**Complexity of the explanation** : how hard or how much expertise is needed to understand it.

**Accuracy of the model**: Accurate models such as DL models are usually complex with low intrinsic explainability; but they may allow for insightful extrinsic explanations. In the model, accuracy, predictive power and complexity are also inter-related.

**Other variables**: intrinsic-global, intrinsic-local, extrinsic-global, and extrinsic-local explanations. For a given category from the 4 above, we can think of explainability as $X_p = \frac{I}{C}$ or plain words: e**X**plainability equals **I**nsight divided by **C**omplexity.

## Map of XAI

An interesting map of XAI is given in the survey [Principles and practice of explainable ML][principles_and_practice] (2021); and is reproduced below:

The <span style="padding:0.15rem; display: inline-block; border-radius:0.5rem; border:0.15rem dashed purple">dashed</span> **Model types** are classic ML models. These are _transparent_ (intrinsically explainable) but _may_ also benefit of post-hoc (post training) explanations, such as visualising it. When transparency is key and their predictions are accurate enough, these may be preferred.

The focus here though, is in XAI methods for explaining _deep learning_ models rather than classic ML models. Complex DL models are usually _opaque_ or "_black-boxes_", but their predictive power is usually higher than classic ML models.

In other words, there are use-cases for each classical and deep learning _models_.

Regarding the explanation _methods_ the paper states:

> Relying on only one technique will only give us a partial picture of the whole story, possibly missing out important information. Hence, combining multiple approaches together provides for a more cautious way to explain a model. (...) At this point we would like to note that there is no established way of combining techniques (in a pipeline fashion),

Which is very interesting!

## Explanation kinds

The survey [Principles and practise of explaining ML models][principles_and_practice] also includes a great table of **explanation kinds**.
A modified version of the table is below:

| Explanation         | Advantages    | Disadvantages | Question |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Local explanations** | Explains the model's behaviour in a local area of interest. Operates on instance-level explanations. | Explanations do not generalize on a global scale. Small **perturbations** might result in very different explanations.| How do small perturbations affect the output / prediction? |
| **Examples**      | Representative items for each class provide insights about the model's internal reasoning. | Examples require human selection. They do not explicitly state what parts of the example influence the model. | How do inputs from different classes compare? And same? |
| **Feature relevance** | They operate on an instance level (some can operate globally). | Methods may make assumptions which do not hold (e.g. feature independence, linearity).| Which input features are most important? |
| **Simplification**  | Simple surrogate models explain opaque ones. | Surrogate models may not approximate original models well. | Can we get local insights by using a simpler model? |
| **Visualizations**  | Easier to communicate to non-technical audiences. Most approaches are intuitive and not hard to implement. | There is an upper bound on how many features can be considered at once. Humans must inspect plots to derive explanations. | Class boundaries? |

Let's now look at methods.
