# Explainable AI - Concepts

There are many definitions of what XAI is. I like to define it as:

> XAI aims to make a model's predictions and operation understandable to humans by providing insights into _why_ a prediction was made and _how_ the model uses input features.

<!-- I want to make the posts very essential, but in case I regret it I leave the commented out paragraphs. -->
<!-- Explainability can be viewed as a trade-off between how empowering an explanation is and how complex it is. This is explored next. -->

## Dimensions of interest

Here the focus is on _some_ aspects of explanations (not of the model).

__Complexity__: how hard it is to understand, operationally measured relative to a reference human or target audience.

__Insight__: how much the explanation empowers users to understand the model, either intuitively or quantitatively. _How does the output change_ if we change this or that feature? _Does it fail in some specific cases_?

__Other variables__: intrinsic-global, intrinsic-local, extrinsic-global, and extrinsic-local explanations. Given a category from the 4 above, we can think of explainability as $X_p = \frac{I}{C}$, that is, equals explanation-insight divided by explanation-complexity.

__Predictive power__ is a property of the _model_, not of the explanation. Highly predictive models such as DL models are usually complex with low intrinsic explainability, but they may allow for insightful extrinsic explanations.

## Taxonomy

Let's now look at how XAI methods are categorized in practice.
An interesting map using __Category, Principle, and Technique__ is given in [Principles and practice of explainable ML][principles_and_practice] (2021); a modified (crop) of the image is reproduced below:

The image also shows a useful classification of explanations by type or kind. Some of these are: textual, visual, Local / Global, Intrinsic / Extrinsic, by examples, using simplification (e.g. fitting a simpler model), feature contributions.

_By examples_ is quite interesting; quoting from [Principles and practice of explainable ML][principles_and_practice]:

> (...) inspect the training dataset in order to sample a number of data points that are representative members of their corresponding class.

Let's now look at some methods.
