These are some of my opinions and ideas after reading [Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of Machine Learning][XX] (2018), [Interpretable and Explainable Machine Learning for Materials Science and Chemistry][XAI4MAT] (2022), and [A Perspective on Explainable Artificial Intelligence Methods: SHAP and LIME][SHAP and LIME] (2024).

A very interesting experiment in terms of explainability was <https://distill.pub>.

## Explanations

Scientific models are expected to be explainable; that is, an expert human can respond to _why_ questions about it.

And yet, deep learning models' operation remains opaque.
So how can we explain deep-learning models? That is what this blog explores.

(Admittedly, in some cases we may be satisfied with the predictive power alone.)

### Definition and characteristics

_Explanation_ can be defined in an intuitive way. First, phrase what we want to know as a "Why question", the answer is a candidate-explanation. Keep asking "Why" until satisfied. Call the process an explanation.

> [!NOTE]
> However, some questions are clearly useful and not "Why" questions, for example: "What role does this neuron play?" In certain sense, any question regarding the "behaviour" or operation of the model is valid, and should admit an explanation as a response.

We can characterise explanations using:

- _Simplicity_: how easy to understand the explanation is. (The opposite term, _complexity_, could be used as well.)
- _Completeness_: how accurately it describes the model's behaviour.

<div class="w40 center">
<a href="../assets/tradeoff.png">
<img alt="graph looking like completeness is the inverse of simplitity." src="../assets/tradeoff.png"/>
</a>
<p>Completeness v. Simplicity tradeoff.</p>
</div>

This trade-off isn't universal but just a common case, particularly in deep learning. However, some models are straightforward, in which case both characteristics are high.

### Correctness

This isn't a characteristic of explanations, but of a model, yet it is often correlated, as represented below (_understandability_ replaces _simplicity_):
