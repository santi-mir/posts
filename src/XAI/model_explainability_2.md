# Model Explainability II

After defining _model explainability_ and the most common kinds of explanations (extrinsic, intrinsic, global, local) let's do a summary of methods.

----------------------

## Overview of methods

There are many methods to identify causes or relevant properties on models, that help explain how they work. Some of them include counterfactuals and comparison, in the same sense as used in our previous section.

For all audiences, we can group these methods into more general categories, and then go into specific cases for a certain audience.

### Kinds of Methods

The survey [Principles and practise of explaining ML models][principles_and_practice] includes a table of **method kinds**. A modified version of the table is below:

| Kind         | Advantages    | Disadvantages | Question |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Local explanations** | Explains the model's behaviour in a local area of interest. Operates on instance-level explanations. | Explanations do not generalize on a global scale. Small **perturbations** might result in very different explanations.| How do small perturbations affect the output / prediction? |
| **Examples**      | Representative items for each class provide insights about the model's internal reasoning. | Examples require human selection. They do not explicitly state what parts of the example influence the model. | How do inputs from different classes compare? And same? |
| **Feature relevance** | They operate on an instance level (some can operate globally). | Methods may make assumptions which do not hold (e.g. feature independence, linearity).| Which input features are most important? |
| **Simplification**  | Simple surrogate models explain opaque ones. | Surrogate models may not approximate original models well. | Can we get local insights by using a simpler model? |
| **Visualizations**  | Easier to communicate to non-technical audiences. Most approaches are intuitive and not hard to implement. | There is an upper bound on how many features can be considered at once. Humans must inspect plots to derive explanations. | Class boundaries? |

A method not listed there are text explanations, which can be generated from an RNN or a language model, reading the model's internal state (for example, this can generate captions).

We should remember that:

> Relying on only one technique will only give us a partial picture of the whole story, possibly missing out important information. Hence, combining multiple approaches together provides for a more cautious way to explain a model. (...) At this point we would like to note that there is no established way of combining techniques (in a pipeline fashion),

In the next posts, we focus on **methods** that aid _causal attribution_ (or cognitive process) with a scientific audience in mind.

### Map of XAI

An interesting map of XAI is given in the survey [Principles and practice of explainable ML][principles_and_practice] (2021).

Most _classic ML_ models are in the <span style="padding:0.15rem; display: inline-block; border-radius:0.5rem; border:0.15rem dashed purple">dashed</span> area under **Model types** column.

_Classic ML_ models are usually _transparent_ (intrinsically explainable) but _may_ benefit from post-hoc (post training) explanations, such as visualising it. When transparency is key and the predictions are accurate enough, these may be preferred over DL models.

To the visual explanations, t-SNE, PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques can be added.

The focus here though, is explaining _deep learning_ models which are often, but not always, more accurate than classic ML models.

<!-- In other words, classical ML and DL models each have their use-cases. -->
