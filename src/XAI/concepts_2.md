# Model Explainability

Explanations were defined and characterised &mdash;in simple terms&mdash; in the previous post.

In Explainable AI (XAI), what primarily needs explanation is the model. _Model explainability_ can be defined as:

> The degree to which we can answer questions about the model's inner working and outputs.

The goal is to explain a model, and do it to some audience (which could be ourselves).

Explainability is made harder with more accurate models, since they tend to be more complex.

Moreover, simple explanations can **oversimplifying** its operation, or lack **generality**.

## Explaining a prediction via counterfactuals
This framework is explained separately from methods to expand a bit more, but some of the methods use counterfactual-like logic behind.

<details><summary>A toy example</summary>

Let's take an imaginary model and its predictions: $\mathbf{y} = f(\mathbf{x})$. One expectation is that it's accurate. Suppose this is modelling weather, and using whether people take an umbrella as input variable. It reaches high accuracy and we are happy.

If we wanted to answer, what if the persons didn't take the umbrella? It does still rain. Why? There may be different reasons:

1. The model is doing correlation/association, but there wasn't correlation data available for such an event, so the predictions bad;
2. The model does not use causal information, like a weather forecast model would (not taking an umbrella doesn't make raining impossible).

Let's say we change it to use causal variables instead. How do we know that we have _all_ the _causal inputs_? And how do we know it has built an accurate _and also robust_ model of the world?

We expect these models to be useful in different cases, but the latter should be more robust.

An expert may frequently select inputs-outputs to a model which are _known causes-effects_, then the models fit the relation of one to the other.

A non-expert know may not know which are the causes, which the effects. And in some cases it does not matter. This is where having a causal graph is relevant for modelling, to identify actual causes as inputs and effects as outputs.

But when the model is already based on a causal graph (first case), a technique of _counterfactuals_ can be used for generating explanations: asking _what if this other input was used instead_, or what if one feature is changed slightly? Such are counterfactual-like questions (if the initial input is considered a fact).

(A logic-inference section could be added, but at the moment I don't see it adding much useful information.)

## Overview of methods

Within the _cognitive process_ of explanations, _model explainability_ benefits from methods to identify causes or relevant properties.

For all audiences, we can group these methods into more general categories, and then go into specific cases for a certain audience.

### Kinds of Methods

The survey [Principles and practise of explaining ML models][principles_and_practice] includes a table of **method kinds**. A modified version of the table is below:

| Kind         | Advantages    | Disadvantages | Question |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Local explanations** | Explains the model's behaviour in a local area of interest. Operates on instance-level explanations. | Explanations do not generalize on a global scale. Small **perturbations** might result in very different explanations.| How do small perturbations affect the output / prediction? |
| **Examples**      | Representative items for each class provide insights about the model's internal reasoning. | Examples require human selection. They do not explicitly state what parts of the example influence the model. | How do inputs from different classes compare? And same? |
| **Feature relevance** | They operate on an instance level (some can operate globally). | Methods may make assumptions which do not hold (e.g. feature independence, linearity).| Which input features are most important? |
| **Simplification**  | Simple surrogate models explain opaque ones. | Surrogate models may not approximate original models well. | Can we get local insights by using a simpler model? |
| **Visualizations**  | Easier to communicate to non-technical audiences. Most approaches are intuitive and not hard to implement. | There is an upper bound on how many features can be considered at once. Humans must inspect plots to derive explanations. | Class boundaries? |

We should remember that:

> Relying on only one technique will only give us a partial picture of the whole story, possibly missing out important information. Hence, combining multiple approaches together provides for a more cautious way to explain a model. (...) At this point we would like to note that there is no established way of combining techniques (in a pipeline fashion),

In the next posts, we focus on **methods** that aid _causal attribution_ (or cognitive process) with a scientific audience in mind.

### Map of XAI

An interesting map of XAI is given in the survey [Principles and practice of explainable ML][principles_and_practice] (2021).

Most _classic ML_ models are in the <span style="padding:0.15rem; display: inline-block; border-radius:0.5rem; border:0.15rem dashed purple">dashed</span> area under **Model types** column.

_Classic ML_ models are usually _transparent_ (intrinsically explainable) but _may_ benefit from post-hoc (post training) explanations, such as visualising it. When transparency is key and the predictions are accurate enough, these may be preferred over DL models.

The focus here though, is explaining _deep learning_ models. These are usually _opaque_ ("_black-box_") models, and their accuracy is usually higher than classic ML models.

In other words, classical ML and DL models each have their use-cases.
