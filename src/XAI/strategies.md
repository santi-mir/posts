# Explainable AI - Strategies

This post is about explainability for deep learning, focusing on some popular ones and their limitations or pitfalls.

## Intrinsic or Representation Methods

Interpreting the model from the inside (intrinsic), with questions such as _what information does the network contain?_.

[Explaining explainability][XX] classifies these at the level of Layer, Neuron, and Vector.

- **Role of Layers**: for example, transfer learning, reusing output of some layers for another task.
- **Role of Units**: <q>The role of such individual units can be understood qualitatively, by creating visualizations of the input patterns that maximize the response of a single unit, or quantitatively, by testing the ability of a unit to solve a transfer problem.</q> from [Explaining Explainability][XX], 2018.
- **Role of Vectors**: for example using Concept Activation Vectors framework.

Another way is to introduce biases like symmetry considerations which can help interpretability.

## Extrinsic or Processing Methods

Many extrinsic methods measure importance of input features determining the output. Two examples are SHAP and LIME. They look at the model as black-box.

### Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)

SHAP applies to the model as-is. It calculates a score for each feature in the model, representing the contribution of that feature to the model's output.[^1]

SHAP can do both global (average across inputs) and local (an given input). It is model-dependent, so different models may yield different scores even using the exact same data and task.

- **Pitfall 1**: The feature-contribution is not a weight or derivative with respect to the inputs. The main focus should be on the order of values (Paper, [Section 2.1][SHAP AND LIME]),
- **Pitfall 2**: It is model dependent: two models trained with same data may have different ranking,
- **Pitfall 3**: does not protect from a biased model.

### Limitations

In the most basic form, both SHAP and LIME methods do not capture multicollinearity between features, and non-linear effects of the features in the output.[^2] They are also model dependent.

Let's describe these effects.

**Collinearity**: one feature is a linear combination of one or more other features. For example, $x_3 = \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_0$; assuming linear independence would be an error.

In the [paper's words][SHAP AND LIME]:

> Indeed, some features might be assigned a low score despite being significantly associated with the outcome. This is because they do not improve the model performance due to their collinearity with other features whose impact has already been accounted for.

**Non-linearity**: output changes are not proportional to input changes. For example $y = \beta x^N$ is non-linear, and fitting a line $y' = \alpha x$ to it would be inaccurate. Some SHAP models can model this correctly.

Luckily, we can get some help:

- Normalised Moving Rate (NMR): tests the stability of the list against the collinearity. Smaller NMR means more stable ordering.
- Modified Index Position (MIP) can be used to address just that, and re-order the importance of features considering their multicollinearity.

In the [paper's words][SHAP AND LIME]:

> [MIP] works similarly to NMR by iteratively removing the top feature and retraining and testing the model. Thereafter, it examines how the features are reordered in the model which implies the effect of collinearity.

These two methods (MIP, NMR) can be useful both in having a reliable sorting of features, and on selecting one &mdash;most stable&mdash; of several methods.

### LIME and other methods

- Linear Proxy Models: Fits a surrogate linear model to the original. For example, Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation (LIME) and Generalised Linear Models (GLMs).
    - LIME does model-agnostic local explanations (for a given input) only. For this reason, it can not be considered an explanation of the whole model (but globals can).
- Salience Maps: aim to explain which portions of the computation (original model) are most important for different inputs.
- Validity Interval Analysis: another technique fitting the NN behaviour to try to extract explanations.
- Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, Non-negative Matrix Factorisation can all help as well. But in a way this is better done by architectures with disentangled representations.

## Explanation-Producing systems

Architectures designed to make explaining part of their operation easier.

- Using Explicit Attention: An attention layer/mask learns how parts of an input embedding pay attention to other parts. The layer is somewhat interpretable. In chemistry, it could learn which atoms connect (or pay attention to) other atoms.

- Dissentangled Representations: "Disentangled representations have individual dimensions that describe meaningful and independent factors of variation." from [Explaining Explainability][XX], 2018. Examples of architectures are $\beta$-VAE, INFOGan, capsule networks.
