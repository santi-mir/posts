# CompChem Map

This is a draft of areas I'd like to organise in some taxonomy.

## Finding Useful Molecules

- Get a Materials Database(s), either method

### Method 1: Direct (Compounds to Properties)

- Use DFT to guide towards one that fits the requirements (slow if we have billions of compounds.),
- _Or_ use the DB to train a NN to make predictions (needs labelled data for training)
- _Or_ similarity metrics to find new (similar) molecules.
- ...

### Method 2: Inverse (Properties to Compounds)

1. Use the gradient to update embedding.
2. Maximise or Minimise the needed properties.

The paper's approach is more towards a **Direct** method. It is a method to generate embeddings that can then be used to train a neural network to predict properties.

This can be arranged (not very tidily) in a chart:

subgraph Direct["`**Direct**`"]
    direction LR
    B("`Electronic Structure
    Predictions`")
    C("`Train NN on DB
    (with labelled data)`")
    D("`Use similarity metrics to
        find nearby candidates`")
end

subgraph Inverse["`**Inverse**`"]
    direction TB
    E("`Train VAE to create
    smooth surface`")
    E --> F("`Link MLP to
        latent vector`")
    F --> G("`Minimise or Maximise pps.
            by changing vector`")
end

A --> Inverse
A --> Direct
