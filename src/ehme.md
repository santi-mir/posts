# EHME: Concepts

In [this paper][EHME] the model _Explainable Hierarchical Monte Carlo Ensemble_ (EHME) is proposed.

In short, _simple models are used to fit a split dataset_.

Three stages of explainability are defined: pre-modelling, modelling and post-modelling explainability. Let's expand on some of the ideas behind this.

## Pre-modelling Explainability

The paper states:

> Pre-modelling explainability refers to dataset preparation to make it suitable for training of explainable models.

The core idea is to **split the dataset** and then use simpler models.

They also use [ElemNet]'s _fractional_ representation is $\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_a n_a \mathbf{h}_a$; an average of one-hot encoded vectors $\mathbf{h}$ of atoms $a$.[^1] This does not make the model later on explainable, but seems reasonable to consider it here.

## Modelling Explainability

The core idea for model explainability is to use euclidean-based probabilities, which is considered explainable.

The _model_ is: $P_i = {\Large \frac{||\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{c}^i||^{-1}}{\sum_{j=1}^m ||\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{c}^j||^{-1}}}$ where $m$ is the number of classes and $||\cdot||$ are euclidean distances between test vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and centroids $\mathbf{c}$.

The closer the vector and centroid are, the higher the probability of the test item belonging to that class.

They propose two methods to generate centroids. In both cases, the centroids are trained using an evolutionary algorithm (EA).

1. Trained Detailed Centroids (TDC):
   - Class centroid independently trained,
   - Params to train: $n\times{}m$ parameters given by $n$ features and $m$ classes,
2. Trained Compressed Centroids (TCC):
   - Class centroid generated from a common centroid,
   - Params to train: $n + m$ (less parameters, compressed).

According to the paper, TDC differs from KNN, which uses _actual centroids_ rather than _trained centroids_.

In TCC, to generate the vector for class $i$, compare components of the common centroid $cc$ to the class parameter $p_i$, that is: $\mathbf{v}^{(i)} = (min (cc_j, p_i))_{j=1}^{n}$.

### Where do models come from?

Remember that the dataset is split into clusters, and each cluster has its own centroids, hence own euclidean distance model.

When the confidence test fails, a new model is run (from another cluster). This repeats until one is confident enough.

## Post-modelling explainability

The hierarchy stems from the _constrain_ in the probability $P$ of membership: $P_{i=max} \gt P_{j=max_2} + \delta$. The test input is passed on to the next model if this doesn't hold.

This stage seems to be just selecting $\delta$ which helps define regions of interest. This is not the calculation of centroids (previous step), but a vector that makes the probabilities of interest equal (0.5 for two classes.)

[^1]: Other approaches require training to produce higher-quality element vectors, such as Mat2Vec or SkipAtom. The performance is not too different though.
